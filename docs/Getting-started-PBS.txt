Introduction

PBS is a commonly used parallel batch system for HPC clusters. This release 
supports PBS by upgrading SynergyV3.0 utilities to include dynamic .sng_hosts
file generation using $PBS_NODEFILE. A number of related utilities, such as "sds" (start daemons), "kads" (kill all daemons) and KILL (kill by string matching) are updated and tested.

File "jobs.sh" contains an example of PBS job script for Synergy parallel 
programs.
