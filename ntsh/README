This directory contains a new version of TSH revised by Feijian Sun based on his Ph.D. Dissertation titled 
"Automatic Sequential-Parallel Program Generation Using Stateless Parallell Processing Principles".
This TSH contains performance improvements using higher level tuple space operations that are generated by the PML-compiler.
Users can also use these operator in manually crafted programs. For details, please read 
http://spartan.cis.temple.edu/images/fsun.PDF. 

This TSH is backward compatible to the old TSH. New operators are added in order to accommodate automatically generated 
parallel programs.
